helpflorida.co
==============
HelpFlorida.co was a campaign website to protest against the robbery of over 10 laptops, tablets, dev phones, 
a pair of air jordon's and hundreds of dollars. With the help of awesome #1000Strong community of StartupBus,
it went viral on the morning of March 9th in Austin, Texas during sxsw. Microsoft @Windows who were running a 
campaign under #sxswproblems ended up noticing it and really helped our hacker/hustler/hipsters friends from 
Florida by replacing their devices by windows hardware. A huge THANK YOU to everyone who helped us.
